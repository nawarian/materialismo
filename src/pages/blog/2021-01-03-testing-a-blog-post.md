So you believe this blog post was written with markdown, right?

Truth is: it wasn't! I'm currently testing the Netlify CMS application which is an open source CMS.

## Here I have a heading 2

I can keep typing any amount of paragraphs and so on. Also I can create other heading levels.

### Such as heading 3

So this should be already sufficient for my tests.
